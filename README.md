# kinesis-client-library-rust
**This KCL reads data from Kinesis Stream and push the data to Elasticsearch & S3.**

**Installation:** runs in a docker container.

It's partially an equivalent to Kinesis Firehose which will be way cheaper as it can run 
in a very resource constraint environment.

This is just an very basic initial version, still under heavy development.
