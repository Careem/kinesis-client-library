# kinesis-client-library-rust
This KCL reads data from Kinesis Stream and push the data to Elasticsearch & S3.

It's partially an equivalent to Kinesis Firehose which will be much way cheaper as it can run 
in a very constraint resource environment.

This is just an very basic initial version, still under development.
